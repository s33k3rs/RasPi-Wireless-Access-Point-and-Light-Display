5.0 Testing

Use some of the following tools to identify if you have any problems with your
Raspberry Pi working.


5.1 To check the connection
ifconfig .


5.2 To check the wifi devices
iwconfig .


5.3 Test hostapd

5.3.1
sudo /usr/sbin/hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf .
For more information on errors add -d or -dd at the end of this command

5.3.2 or try
sudo systemctl status hostapd .


5.4 Test dnsmasq
systemctl status dnsmasq –l .
For more information on errors add -d or -dd at the end of this command


5.5 To view iptables
sudo iptables –L .


5.6 To check dhcpcd
systemctl status dhcpcd.service .
For more information on errors add -d or -dd at the end of this command


5.7 To check rng-tools
sudo service rng-tools status .


5.8 To check connectivity to an address
ping 8.8.8.8.
This is ping the Google domain address. Troubleshoot by pinging other IP addresses.
Start with IP addresses within the Pi and then move further out (i.e. network router)


5.9 To check connectivity to an address
traceroute 8.8.8.8.
This command is similar to ‘ping’, but it will show more information by displaying the
path the packet follows to reach the final IP address. Again, choose any IP address
needed.
