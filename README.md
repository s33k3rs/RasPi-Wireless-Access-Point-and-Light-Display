# RasPi-Wireless-Access-Point-and-Light-Display
A guide on how to set up a Wireless Access Point on Raspberry Pi 3B+ using Raspbian Stretch. There is also an optional project to display the internet connection through the Blinkt! LED display

This guide was created to be used on Raspberry Pi using Raspbian Stretch only. It will not work on older, or possibly newer versions.

Various sources have been used for this guide and and full credits go to them all in the reference list.

The Blinkt! attachment is not necesary for the Wireless Access Point to work.
